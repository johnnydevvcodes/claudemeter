# claudemeter

A tiny **Claude Code status line** that shows your usage as clean, color-coded progress bars — right in your terminal, on every prompt.

```
current session: ▰▰▰▰▰▰  78%  [resets in 1h 6m]
all models:      ▰▰▰▰▰▰  24%  [resets Tue 5:59 AM]
fable:           ▰▰▰▰▰▰  15%  [resets Tue 5:59 AM]
```

- 🟢 **green** under 50% · 🟡 **yellow** 50–79% · 🔴 **red** 80%+
- Runs **100% locally** — reads your `~/.claude` logs via [`ccusage`](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage). **Sends nothing to any API and consumes zero tokens or plan quota.**

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnydevvcodes/claudemeter/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then start a new Claude Code session (or reload). That's it.

The installer will:
1. Check for **Node.js** (required).
2. Install **ccusage** globally if it's missing.
3. Drop `claudemeter-statusline.js` into `~/.claude/`.
4. Add a `statusLine` entry to `~/.claude/settings.json` — **existing settings are preserved** and a `settings.json.bak` backup is written.

### Install from a local checkout

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnnydevvcodes/claudemeter.git
cd claudemeter
./install.sh
```

## What the bars mean

The default layout shows three rows, **all driven by real data**:

| Row | Source | Live? |
|---|---|---|
| **current session** | Elapsed % of your active 5-hour block, with a reset countdown | ✅ **live** |
| **all models** | Your **real** combined weekly token usage (via `ccusage`) | ✅ **live** |
| **fable** | Your **real** weekly token usage for Fable models | ✅ **live** |
| **context** *(opt-in)* | Context-window fill % of the current conversation | ✅ **live** |

The weekly rows show **this week's actual token usage** as a percentage of a **budget** (a ceiling you set), with a reset countdown to the calendar-week rollover.

> ### ℹ️ About the weekly percentage — set a `budget`
> A percentage needs a ceiling. Your **true plan-limit** (what Claude's `/usage` panel divides by) lives on Anthropic's servers and is **not exposed to any script** — only Claude Code's built-in `/usage` can read it. So claudemeter divides your real usage by a **budget you choose**:
>
> - **With a `budget`** (recommended) — `pct = this week's tokens ÷ your weekly token allowance`. Meaningful and honest.
> - **Without a `budget`** — it falls back to *% of your busiest week on record*, which is real but often reads **100%** during a heavy week.
>
> Set `budget` (in tokens) per row in the config, or `"weekly": []` to hide these rows and rely on `current session` alone.

## Configure (optional)

Create `~/.claude/claudemeter.config.json` (see [`claudemeter.config.example.json`](./claudemeter.config.example.json)):

```json
{
  "barWidth": 6,
  "showContext": false,
  "weekly": [
    { "label": "all models", "model": "all", "budget": 250000000 },
    { "label": "fable", "model": "fable", "budget": 20000000 }
  ]
}
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `barWidth` | `6` | Number of segments per bar |
| `showContext` | `false` | Show the live context-window bar (opt-in) |
| `weekly` | live `all models` + `fable` | Weekly rows (see below). Set to `[]` to hide them. |

**Weekly row entries** can be either:

| Style | Fields | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Live** (recommended) | `label`, `model`, `budget?`, `resets?` | Real weekly tokens ÷ `budget`. `model` is `"all"` or a model-name substring (e.g. `"fable"`, `"opus"`, `"sonnet"`). `budget` is in tokens; omit it to use *% of your peak week*. `resets` overrides the auto week-rollover countdown. |
| **Static** | `label`, `pct`, `resets?` | A fixed placeholder number you edit by hand. |

## How it works — and is it safe?

Short version: **yes, it's safe, and it costs you nothing.** `claudemeter` is a small, readable Node script that runs entirely on your machine.

- **No network, no API calls.** The status line shells out to [`ccusage`](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage), which only *reads* the local log files Claude Code already writes to `~/.claude`. Nothing is uploaded anywhere.
- **Zero tokens, zero plan quota.** Because it never talks to a model, it can't consume tokens or eat into your usage limits. The status line text isn't part of the conversation sent to the model either — it's just UI.
- **The only cost is a few milliseconds of local CPU** each time the status line refreshes (roughly once per prompt), to spawn `node` + `ccusage`.
- **Your settings are preserved.** The installer merges a single `statusLine` key into `~/.claude/settings.json` and writes a `settings.json.bak` backup first. Uninstall removes it cleanly — and only if it still points at this tool.
- **Read before you pipe.** Running any `curl … | bash` installer means trusting the script. This one is short — [read `install.sh`](./install.sh) and [`statusline.js`](./statusline.js) first, or clone and run locally.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
- **Node.js** 18+
- **ccusage** (installed automatically) — or it falls back to `npx ccusage`

## Uninstall

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnydevvcodes/claudemeter/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```

Removes the script and the `statusLine` entry (only if it still points at this tool).
